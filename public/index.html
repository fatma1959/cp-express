        <p>Jewellery has played an important role in human life for thousands of years. We learn from history that ancient civilisations appreciated jewellery and it was used to highlight the natural beauty of its wearers. Different pieces were worn to symbolise different messages such as security, wisdom, elegance, and prosperity.</p>
